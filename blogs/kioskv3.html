        <h1 class="padding">KioskV3, We've had V1 with github, V2 with apple and now V3. It was pretty simple to find actually. Heres some things before we start. 1. This has been possible the entire time but has been helped by goguardian purchasing edulastic. 2. This requires you to have a microsoft account. Okay, so basically I was bored during lunch just messing around with what power washes and what I did was I went to edulastic and clicked microsoft, instead of signing in with github though I signed in with my actual microsoft account. (if you forget your password click forget password and when it says Microsoft - Account in the top left corner click the logo. Now that your on the main microsoft site search literally anything and then in the top right click "view sitemap" after that scroll down to services and click bing. done! pretty simple tbh. definitely simpler than kiosk v1. atm this isn't an actual listed guide even thought it works, in about a day I'll have the fully working one up under "Guides"</h1>
